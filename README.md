## Basics

1. Journaling: A user will have the ability to privately write, store, track content entered by the user via a series of questions.

2. Questions: A user will be prompted several questions about daily activities, diet, relationships, etc to gain specific criteria for the journal entry.

3. Journal Entries: As time goes on, daily use can yeild a long term repository of personal thoughts. Security is key.

4. Security: For now, the data is stored in JSON on local storage API mainly just to get something working. In the future, the Todo outline will encourage a more secure path.

5. To Do list: We will track development progress via this readme in the TODO section.

6. Development: The UI will be flat, easy to use, minimally animated with CSS3 transitions. Step by step questionaire and a display console that outlines activity, notes, moods, and goals.

7. Moods: We will have a tool that will track and display both short term and long term trends in daily mood.  This tool will be encouranged to be utilized at the same time daily.

8. Goals: As the user tracks risk and evaluates any scenario, they would be able to set goals specific to the solution needed.

9. Developing a scenario: After going through a basic questionaire, the tool will be available on the review page upon selecting a date. Once a date is selected, that "daily file" will allow you to view but not edit notes.  More notes may be appended and there will be several areas for input regarding scenarios developed from the daily file. 

10. Daily file: Everyday upon loggin in, a new daily file will be created.  All previously created daily files will be archived.

11. Archive: A repository of previously documented data.

12. Deleting Archived Data: On the archive page, each date can be selected to either load or delete.  A popup prompt will be activated when the delete button is invoked.
